# What is this repo?
This repo exists as an archive of all devlogs posted [here](https://nameheregames.itch.io/lone-sol/devlog).

This allows me to keep everything in one place - especially given that I keep having issues with itch.io's devlog editor.

This repo contains all art uploads and HTML posts.
